# RAG-based Chatbot for LUMS

This project aims to develop a chatbot that utilizes **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** for answering queries related to Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). The chatbot retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and uses generative models to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

## Project Status
- **In Progress**: The chatbot is currently under development, with the retrieval and generation mechanisms being fine-tuned. Future updates will focus on improving the response accuracy and expanding the knowledge base.

## Features
- **Query Handling**: Answers queries related to LUMS, including information on admissions, campus facilities, and academic programs.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation**: Combines retrieval-based approaches with generative models to produce high-quality answers.
